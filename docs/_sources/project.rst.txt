Project Summary
===============

Background
----------
Inadequate housing quality is a risk factor for a variety of negative health outcomes that are primarily experienced by people who live in developing countries. Properly identifying the geographic scope and magnitude of this problem is critical to designing effective interventions for those who experience the highest levels of risk.
Large-scale household survey datasets exist for many countries, but the variety of housing types used globally make it challenging to synthesize this data. Conversion of raw string descriptions of housing materials into ordinal values depicting the overall quality of a home will make quantitative analysis on a global scale feasible and allow for prediction modelling in order to identify high-risk areas.

User Profile
--------------
The intended users of this tool are researchers who study housing quality in developing countries.
You may have some level of Python experience, but those of you who cannot program in Python will also be able to browse the web in a research setting and interpret data visualizations in order to draw conclusions within your area of expertise.
Given the variety of userbase experience, this toolkit will allow users to interact with both intermediate outputs and visualizations within Jupyter notebooks and also provide static outputs and visualizations that will increase user-friendliness - adding utility to novice users.

Data Sources
------------
This software has been trained on 262 datasets from the Demographic and Health Surveys (DHS), consisting of housing quality surveys in developing countries. The relative housing quality of each household is then computed using an ordinal system, with values representing levels of roof, wall and floor materials.
